Chrome extension for prototyping a "split reader". I.E: when you are reading documentation instead of following
links to new tabs or windows split the current document and follow in-place.

Think of it as splitting a linux terminal.

## Usage

1. Install the extension (download repo and [load unpacked extension](chrome://extensions))
2. Use modifiers when clicking links to open in a split mode:
     - `Ctrl+Shift+Click` - Split vertically
     - `Ctrl+Alt+Click` - Split horizontally
